UdemyClone Project Update – CSS Positions, Animations & Responsive Design

Overview:

This project is an updated version of my website where I enhanced the layout, design, and responsiveness using CSS positions, CSS animations, and media queries.

CSS Positions:

Improved the structure and alignment of elements using different CSS position properties such as relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky to create a well-organized layout.

Added smooth animations and transition effects to make the website more interactive and visually appealing. Used keyframes and hover effects to enhance user experience.
